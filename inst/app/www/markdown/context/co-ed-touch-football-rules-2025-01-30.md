## Cancellations

Football is a game of elements. As such, we expect very few cancellations due to weather. However, in the event of a cancellation, we will send out a league wide email to all participants. This could occur as early as 8:00 am on the day of the games. However, if games have begun and the field conditions change, it could occur later in the day. Games will be rescheduled to a later date pending field space availability.

## Player Eligibility, Rosters and Team Composition

1. All players must be at least 18 years of age.

2. All players are required to create a Game On! user account and accept the electronic waiver. A player is considered ineligible and may not participate until these tasks are completed. A team may be penalized with a loss for any game in which they use ineligible players, regardless of whether or not a protest was filed.

3. A team roster must have a minimum of 9 players but is limited to a maximum of 18 players.
   
   a. The roster minimum is designed to help minimize forfeits
   
   b. If a team does not have the minimum number of players, the league reserves the right to add free agents to their roster.

4. Teams are allowed to ADD to their roster, until they hit the maximum of 18 players. Once a player is listed on a team roster, they CANNOT BE REMOVED.

5. Players may NOT switch teams after the league schedule has been posted.

6. Roster Additions:
   
   a. After the league schedule has been posted, only players who have been approved by league officials may be added to a roster.
   
   b. All captains who wish to add a player to their roster must do so by 5 PM of the Friday prior to Week 4 of the regular season.
   
   c. Players who are added to the roster will have 1 week to pay the registration fee. If the full registration fee is not paid by the Friday prior to the start of week 5 the player will be removed from the roster, and will not be eligible to participate in the league's postseason (any guest passes paid prior to Week 4 will be credited towards the registration fee).

7. Rosters are frozen at 5 PM on the Friday prior to Week 4 of the season.

8. Substitute players may register for a Guest Pass for individual games. See the Guest Pass page, on the main menu bar, on the website for more details.

   a. All Guest Pass submissions are subject to review by Game On! Management. Guest passes are meant to help bring new people into the league and to help prevent teams from forfeiting games. Captains are not to guest pass players for competitive reasons. A guest pass that is submitted may be denied by Game On! Management.
   
   b. If a team is using a Guest Pass player or players, they must notify the opposing team, prior to the start of their game. This will help minimize confusion or unnecessary roster checks during or after the game.
   
   c. An individual person may use a Guest Pass no more than 5 times for a team in a single outdoor football session.
   
   d. You may not guest pass for another team if you appear on another roster within that teams division.

9. Players may be listed on only one (1) team roster in any given division.
   
   a. A player may be listed on no more than 3 rosters.
   
   b. No more than 3 players from a single team may appear on the same team in a different division.
   
   c. No more than 2 teams shall have the same three common players.
   
   d. The reason for these rules is to maintain the competitive balance across divisions and prevent teams from relying on the same individuals to complete their roster. It will also help maintain the competitive balance between divisions.

10. A team shall field no more than 6 players at a time. A minimum of 2 players must be female.

11. **SHORT-HANDED RULE:** For regular season only. You cannot borrow players for playoff games. If a team finds themselves short-handed and cannot field a team of six (6) players, they may borrow substitute players from other teams. A team may use only ONE of the following combinations of borrowed players to reach a maximum of six (6) players:
    
    a. one (1) male
    
    b. one (1) female
    
    c. one (1) male and one (1) female
    
    This means a team may borrow, at most, only two (2) players to field a squad of six (6) players. A team may never exceed four (4) male and/or two (2) female players when borrowing players.
    
    If after borrowing players, the team still does not have six (6) players, they must play short-handed, or use Guest Passes to add players.
    
    Any borrowed players must be eligible players, meaning on a roster and having accepted the waiver. Any borrowed players beyond the limits set above are considered illegal players. Illegal players may be challenged with a protest at or before the first time they step on the field to play. Once an opponent allows a team to use illegal players, they lose the ability to protest the players. See Protest header for more info.

## Uniforms

1. In order to minimize confusion on the field, each team must select a uniform color.
   
   a. Colors are awarded on a first come, first serve basis of fully registered and paid teams
   
   b. Captains are asked, at the time of registration, for 2nd and 3rd choices in case their primary choice has been taken.

2. The league will supply uniforms to each member on the team roster.

   a. You are welcome to customize the shirt. However, you must not modify the league logo on the front or any sponsor logo on the back. We also ask that you be tasteful and respectful in your customization.

   b. Those who miss the Regular Registration, and register under the Late Registration period, may end up with a league-supplied shirt not of the same color as the rest of their team, or may not end up with a shirt at all, depending on when they registered and when the shirt order was placed. In either case, they may end up having to wear a league-supplied scrimmage vest or bring their own shirt to match the rest of their team.

3. Each rostered player is encouraged to wear the league-supplied shirt for their team. This is how the staff and/or referees will be able to quickly tell if you are a registered participant without wasting 15 minutes of playing time doing roster checks for each game.

4. If a person or persons not wearing their league-supplied uniform is believed to not be a rostered player by a Game On! Staff Member, they will not be able to participate until they are verified as a registered participant.

   a. This verification will be performed by a Game On! staff member. Please note, other league duties may take precedence over the verification and may delay the verification.

   b. This verification will require a government-issued photo ID to match against the team roster. If the player cannot provide a photo ID to match against the roster, they will not be allowed to play.

   c. This verification will take place AFTER the scheduled game has begun. The game will not be delayed for this verification. Depending on how many players are without their uniform, this could mean a team loses their opportunity to call a coin toss. It may also mean a team has to play with fewer than 6 players (maybe even 0) on the field, until the verification process is completed.

5. Guest Pass or borrowed players must supply their own shirt of the same (or very similar) color as the team for which they are substituting. If Guest Pass or borrowed players are not wearing the team color, the entire team may have to wear league-supplied scrimmage vests to prevent confusion for opposing players and referees, alike.

6. When teams of the same or similar color (i.e. Navy and Black) play each other, the visiting team (listed first on the schedule) must wear league-supplied scrimmage vests to differentiate the players.

## Equipment

1. Metal spikes or cleats are not allowed. If there is any exposed metal on your footwear (this includes metal tipped rubber spikes), the referee has the authority to ask the player to change footwear or remove them from the game.

2. Teams may use their own football for their drives on offense. The following is a list of regulations regarding balls:
   
   a. Balls must be collegiate or professional size. No youth balls.
   
   b. Balls must be made of leather or synthetic leather. (i.e. no foam balls)
      
      i. Official-sized Under Armor balls made of rubber are allowed.
   
   c. Balls must be clean and free of foreign substances or debris. Foreign substances are defined as anything that would not be on the ball after it leaves the factory or that is not normally located on the playing field.

3. A team may decide to change balls once an offensive series has begun. If they choose to do so, they must notify the referees and the opposing team.

4. Players may wear gloves when playing. The gloves must be clean and free of foreign substances. Foreign substances are defined as anything that would not be on the gloves after they leave the factory or that is not normally located on the playing field.

## Playing Field

1. The playing field shall be drawn with white field paint.

2. The playing field shall be marked with yellow and orange cones.
   
   a. Yellow disc cones will mark the sidelines
   
   b. Tall cones will mark the end zones. During windy conditions.

3. The playing field dimensions are 30 yards wide by 66 yards long

4. The goal line to goal line dimension is 50 yards

5. Each end zone is 8 yards deep

6. There are three (3) point after touchdown (PAT) lines in front of each end zone:
   
   a. The one (1) point line is five (5) yards from the end zone
   
   b. The two (2) point line is ten (10) yards from the end zone
   
   c. The three (3) point line is fifteen (15) yards from the end zone
   
   d. Once a line is declared for a try, the team may not change their mind. Even if a penalty or time-out is called on their try.

7. An orange pylon will be placed at each corner of the end zone

8. Additional orange cones will be placed on the end line, 10 yards from either sideline, or as needed to help identify the end lines and sidelines of a field.

9. Six (6) yellow disc-style cones will be placed along each sideline at the PAT lines.

10. A seventh (7th) yellow disc-style cone will be placed on each sideline to designate the middle of the field.

## Regulation Game and Time Keeping

1. Prior to the start of the game, a coin toss will decide who starts with the first possession. The team listed on the schedule as the "Away" team will call the coin toss. There is no deferral. The team that wins the coin toss must make one of three choices:

   a. Choose to start with the ball
   
   b. Choose to start on defense
   
   c. Choose a direction (end zone to defend)

   The team that loses the coin toss will make a decision on the remaining choices.
   
   **NOTE:** Possession and end zone defended are reversed when starting the 2nd half.

2. A regulation game will be 50 minutes in length.

3. The game will be split into two (2) 25-minute halves, with no half-time.

4. There will be a 30-second play clock. The clock begins when the official spots the ball. The offense must snap the ball prior to the expiration of the 30-second play clock.

   a. The ball is considered spotted when, after the play is over, it is returned to the line of scrimmage.
   
      i. Ideally, the referees will be the ones returning the ball to the line of scrimmage. However, sometimes, the players decide to keep the ball themselves. In these cases, the referee must use their judgment and start the play clock when they feel they, as referees, would have the ball to the line of scrimmage. This will prevent teams from slowly walking the ball to the huddle to waste the game clock.

      ii. Sometimes teams prefer not to place the ball on the ground, especially if the ground is wet. It is OK for the teams to keep the ball with them in the huddle. Therefore, the ball does not have to remain at the line of scrimmage. In this case, the play clock would start as soon as the ball reaches the line of scrimmage.

5. The game clock is a running clock and will stop only for the following reasons:

   a. Team time-out: called by and charged to one of the teams. The first two team time-outs are 30 seconds long. The play clock will start after 30-seconds; however, the game clock will not start until the ball is snapped. The defense can use the full 30-second play clock to get ready after a time-out.
   
      i. Third (3rd) team time-out will only stop the game clock. There is no 30 second break. The 30 second play clock will start immediately and the defense can use the full 30-second play clock to get ready after the time-out. The game clock will start at the snap.

      ii. **NOTE:** If a team calls a time-out after a touchdown, but prior to the PAT attempt, the clock will remain stopped through the PAT attempt and will not begin until the first snap of the following offensive series.

   b. Officials' time-out: called by one of the officials to discuss a call or ruling. An Officials' time-out should be kept very brief.

   c. Injury time-out: called by one of the officials when there is a player injury in which the player is laying on the field and/or does not get immediately back into action.
   
      i. When this occurs, the player(s) for whom the clock has been stopped must be removed from the field and they must remain off the field for the next play. If a team does not have a substitute, from their own roster, on the sideline, ready to play, they must play short-handed.

      ii. A team may opt to use their team time-out, providing they have one, to eliminate the need for the player, for whom the injury time-out was called, to sit for a play. The reasoning is a team time-out would take as long as or longer than a normal play might take. If players from each team were asked to sit a play due to the injury time-out, a single time-out called by either team will allow all players to return.

   d. Delay of game penalty in the last 5 minutes of the 2nd half.

6. The game clock and play clocks will be kept by one official on the same timing device.

7. Each team will receive three (3) time-outs per game.

   a. The first two time-outs will be standard 30 second team time-outs.
   
   b. The third time-out will simply stop the clock and the 30 play clock will begin immediately after the ball is spotted. The clock will start on the snap of the ball.

8. If a game goes to overtime, each team will receive only one (1) time-out to use after the end of regulation time, regardless of how many overtime periods are played.

9. If the football goes over the fence accidentally in any fashion, the game clock will stop until the football is returned to the playing field.

   a. The game clock will start as soon as the football is returned.

10. Any actions that the referee sees as a deliberate attempt to manipulate the clock will result in a penalty. Examples include but not limited to:

    a. The losing team throws the ball over the fence on purpose late in the half/game in an effort to stop the clock. In this case, a delay of game penalty will be assessed and the clock will continue to run.

    b. If the offensive team is attempting to run additional time off the clock or intentionally commits offensive penalties in an effort to replay downs, the ref may stop the clock and issue a delay of game penalty.

## Overtime Periods

### Regular Season

1. There is no overtime in the regular season. A game may end in a tie.

### Playoffs

1. The overtime periods will be similar to NCAA rules: each team will have an attempt to score going in the same direction, towards the same endzone.

2. Each overtime period will consist of one possession for each team.

3. There will not be a game clock. However, the play clock will be functional.

4. A coin toss will determine which team gets the first possession of overtime. The home team will call the coin toss for the overtime period.

5. Each possession will begin at the team's own 5-yard (1-point) line and last until the ball is turned over (via interception or downs) or the team scores a touchdown.

6. If at the end of an overtime period, the score remains tied, there will be a subsequent overtime period.

7. In subsequent overtime periods, the teams will swap order of possession and goal defended. For example, the team that had the ball first in the first overtime period will have the ball last in the second overtime period. In addition, they will be driving toward the end zone they had defended in the previous overtime period. The alternating of possession and goal defended will occur for each overtime period.

## Forfeits

1. To avoid a forfeit, teams are encouraged to borrow players under the Short-Handed rules or have substitute players register with a Guest Pass.

2. In the event of a forfeit, the teams at the field are NOT to pay the referees. The referees will report the forfeit to the league, and the league will pay the referee fee using the refundable forfeit fee of the forfeiting team.

3. The team that forfeited will have 3 days to replenish their refundable forfeit fee. This amount will be used in case the team forfeits a second game. If the team does not forfeit a second game, the money will be returned at the end of the season.

4. If the fee is not received within 3 days of the forfeited game, that team will not be allowed to play their next scheduled game. This will, also, be considered a forfeit.

5. A forfeited game will be recorded as a win (W), in favor of the non-forfeiting team. The forfeiting team will also lose one (1) standing point.

6. Two (2) forfeits may make a team ineligible for playoffs and may result in removal from the league.

## Protests

1. A protest may only be made if a team feels their opponent is using ineligible and/or illegal players.

2. **Illegal Player**

   An illegal Player may be discovered by the Game On! Staff Field Manager, Owner or by an opposing team captain. The team captain must notify the officials. At this time the on-site staff or owner will be called to perform a roster check. If the player/players are not listed on the teams official roster, they will be considered illegal.

### Illegal Player Definition

An illegal player is a player who has participated for at least 1 play, for a team, but does not appear on their official league roster.

**Note:** players may participate in games, while not appearing on the league roster if they:

- Filled out the guest pass form and paid the guest pass fee of $15 and do not appear on a roster within the same division of the team they are guest passing for.
- Subbing under the league's short handed rules (please refer to the short handed section of league rules).

### Roster Verification

In order to prove they are a rostered player and to expedite the process the individual in question must provide their first and last name, as well as their DOB, or produce a valid photo ID.

If the on-site staff member is unable to verify and must sit out the game. Therefore, it is very important for players to use their REAL NAMES in their user account which populates their team rosters.

If a player does not have photo ID or is unable to provide first name, last name and DOB, they cannot be verified and will have to sit out the game.

### Illegal Players Penalty

#### Regular Season

If a player is deemed to be an illegal, they have the option to fill out the league guest pass, or the offending team will receive a penalty. If doing so violates league roster rules (too many common players on teams in different divisions or the player already plays on a team within the same division) then the individual can not guest pass, the team will be assessed a penalty and the player will have to sit out the remainder of the game.

#### Playoffs

Game On! does not allow subs or guest pass players for playoffs. Only individuals appearing on the team's official roster may participate. Captains are responsible for reviewing their roster prior to the game and confirming that all who intend to participate appear on the official roster. There are no exceptions, as the player does not have the option to fill out the guest pass, and a penalty will be enforced.

### Penalty for an Illegal Player

The offending team will give up a female TD and 1-point conversion (9 points) to their opponent. In addition, if on offense, the offending team will immediately be issued a turnover on downs. If the offending team is on defense they will forego their next offensive possession.

If the game has been stopped due to roster checks, and no roster violations are found on the team being challenged and/or if roster violations are found on the roster of the protesting team, then the protesting team will give up a female TD and 3-point conversion (11 points) to their opponent for wasting everyone's time.

If both teams have illegal players, both teams give up points.

## Scoring

1. A touchdown will be awarded when the following occur:

   a. The ball breaks the plane of the goal line while in possession of a player.
   
   b. A player makes a reception with at least one (1) foot in the end zone and is not also declared out of bounds with their other foot while at the same time having both feet cross beyond the plane of the goal line.
   
      i. This means you CANNOT have a player place their toes of one foot across the goal line and then stretch out as far as they can toward the 1-point line and reach out for the ball to score a TD.

      ii. A player making a 1-footed catch along the sides or back of the endzone would still count, as long as their other foot does not come down out of bounds before the catch is complete, because both of their feet would have crossed the goal line in these cases.

   c. **NOTE:** If a player is in the end zone, with BOTH feet in the end zone, the ball does not have to cross the goal line to count as a touchdown. This is a non-contact, two-hand touch league. A player may not be shoved out of the end zone to prevent a score. When a player is tagged down, the ball is spotted where the tag is made. If the player is tagged in the end zone, the ball would be spotted in the end zone. Therefore, a touchdown would be scored.
   
   d. If a player's knees are down outside of the goalline, they will have been considered to have conceded their ability to advance the ball, and a touchdown will not be awarded, the ball will be placed at the 5 yard line, if there are any remaining downs to be played.

2. A touchdown scored by a male player is worth 6 points.

3. A touchdown scored by a female player is worth 8 points. A female touchdown is defined as a touchdown scored by a female player throwing a touchdown pass, a female player running for a touchdown or a female player receiving a pass for a touchdown.

4. After a touchdown, the offense attempts a PAT from either the 5-yard line for 1 point, from the 10-yard line for 2 points, or from the 15-yard line for 3 points.

   a. Once a team declares from which line they will attempt the PAT, they may not change their decision; even if there is a penalty or time-out called during the try.

   b. If a PAT is intercepted by the defensive team and is returned for a touchdown by the defensive team, it counts as 2 points for the defense.
   
      i. Only two points will be awarded regardless of the line (5yd, 10yd or 15yd) the offense teams attempted the PAT from

      ii. A PAT attempt ends when the ball is dead by rule
      
      iii. If the ball is turned over multiple times during a PAT attempt the offensive team will be rewarded their original point designation regardless of the number of times the ball is turned over. The defensive team will be rewarded 2 points, regardless of the number of times the ball is turned over.

5. A safety is worth 2 points. The team that scored the safety gets the ball back at their 10-yard (2-point) line.

   a. A fumble in the end zone will count as a safety.

## Offense

1. The opening possession of each half and each possession following a touchdown shall begin at a team's own 5-yard line.

2. The offense has 30-seconds from the spot of the ball to start their play.

3. Prior to snapping the ball on the first down of an offensive series, the offense must check with the defense to see if they are ready. After this, the offense may snap the ball whenever they want within the time of the 30-second play clock.

4. A team will have five (5) downs to score.

5. In order to keep everyone involved in the game, at least one of those five (5) downs must involve a female player. If a team involves a female player in two (2) or more plays during the same offensive series, they will receive an additional or 6th down.

   a. Female involvement is defined as:

      i. A female player attempting a forward pass
      
      ii. A female player running the ball. (The play does not have to gain positive yardage.)
      
      iii. A female player being the intended receiver of a pass
      
      iv. A female player makes a reception, regardless to whom the pass was originally intended. (i.e. a male player tips/bobbles a ball and a female player chases it down and catches it)

   b. The following attempts do not qualify as female player involvement:

      i. A male quarterback hands the ball to a female player who then hands it back to a male player to be thrown or run.

      ii. A male quarterback's pass attempt is intended for a female player, but is knocked down at the line of scrimmage. Since the ball did not travel anywhere, it is difficult to determine to whom the pass was intended.

      iii. A male quarterback's pass attempt is intended for a female player, but a male player from the same team catches the ball or drops the ball while trying to catch it. If the ball was intended for the female player, the male should not have been involved in the play. Often times, this is a very difficult judgment call; therefore, it will be ruled as a non-female involvement play.

      iv. A female quarterback (signal caller) hands the ball off to a male player to run or attempt a forward pass.

      v. A pass attempt at a female player who has gone out of bounds and is now an ineligible receiver.

      1. However, if another receiver or defender touches the ball first and the female player CATCHES the ball, it would count as female involvement play because after the touch by others she is now eligible and the catch follows rule 5,a, iv above.
         
      2. If she were to drop said pass that was tipped by a male player on her team it would still NOT count as female involvement if touched for similar reasons as rule 5, b, iii above.

6. If a team can only field four (4) male players and zero (0) female players, then their offense has only four (4) downs to score.

7. The offense has the option to punt on any down up to and including 5th down. However, in order to punt, the team must have performed at least one (1) female involvement play prior to punting. If a team has reached the 6th down, they must play the final down without punting.

   a. On a punt, the opposition then takes possession at their 10-yard line.
   
   b. For further clarification, a team cannot punt anytime the down count ends in 2 (i.e. 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, 4-2, 5-2)

8. If a team decides to huddle between plays (without taking a time-out), the team is only allowed to have six (6) players (with no more than 4 male players) in the huddle. Furthermore, those players in the huddle, when the huddle breaks, are the only ones allowed to participate in the play that follows the huddle unless a time-out is taken. You can substitute players while the team is still huddled.

9. If a team is running a no-huddle offense, once a player becomes set at or near the line of scrimmage, they may not be substituted until after the ensuing play.

10. We do not play on standard football fields. In addition, our fields are often spaced close to each other and oriented in manners for which the various parks and open spaces allow. In addition, oftentimes, both opponents share the same sideline or end line. Therefore, we do not have designated bench areas for substitution, as typical football does. Therefore, when substituting players, they may leave and/or enter the field from any sideline or end line. However, if entering or leaving from an area different than where the majority of the team players seem to be congregating, the player must announce their intentions of leaving or entering the field of play.

11. A legal formation will have at least one (1) player on each side of the ball or center.

12. The offensive team must be set prior to the snap. Being set means no more than one (1) player in motion, at the time the ball is snapped. A player in motion may move in any direction, but may not cross the line of scrimmage prior to the ball being snapped.

13. The ball must be snapped from the middle area (middle 10-yards) of the field to the quarterback.

    a. The center (player snapping the ball) must snap to the quarterback and only the quarterback. A ball snapped to any other player on the field (offensive or defensive) is considered a dead ball and loss of down.

    b. The quarterback is the offensive player calling the signals.

       i. The quarterback's signal calls must be audible and loud enough for the sideline official to hear so they may start the rushing 5-count appropriately.

       ii. A silent count is not allowed.
       
       iii. The play begins on the QB's call for the ball, not the ball movement. Offensive players can move and the referee will begin the 5-count at this time.

       iv. If you are a QB using call signals that are drastically different than "Ready, Set, Go" or "Set, Hike", you should review your calls with the referee at the line of scrimmage so they know when to properly begin the 5-count

    c. There must be separation of the ball from the quarterback prior to the actual snap by the center. The quarterback must not contact the ball prior to the snap.

14. If a team decides to change footballs after an offensive series has begun, they must notify the referees and opposing team.

15. The quarterback cannot run the ball past the line of scrimmage, after receiving the ball from the center. If the QB hands the ball off to another player and then is the recipient of a subsequent hand-off or a forward pass, then they may run the ball past the line of scrimmage.

16. If an offensive player leaves the field of play (i.e. goes out-of-bounds) for any reason, they cannot be the first player to touch the ball.

    a. If the player is a female and ball is thrown to them, it DOES NOT count as a female involvement play because they are an ineligible receiver until the ball is touched by another receiver or defender. See rule 5, b, v above for further detail.

17. A receiver must have at least one foot in bounds for a legal catch. If a receiver has one foot on the ground out of bounds, either before or at the time of the reception, the receiver is ruled out of bounds. The white paint used for marking field boundaries is considered out of bounds.

18. A catch or possession of the ball is defined as having control of the ball and making a football move.

19. A fumble is considered a dead ball. The ball will be spotted at the feet of the player who fumbled or the spot where the ball hit the ground, whichever is farther from the end zone.

20. An offensive player carrying the ball is considered tagged down when a defensive player touches the offensive player with two (2) hands and verbally acknowledges the tag.

    a. The ball is an extension of the player's body.

       i. A hand on the ball is considered a hand on the body for purposes of tag
       
       ii. An attack on the ball (for example, in an effort to knock it free) is considered an attack on the player's body, and will therefore be ruled as Unsportsmanlike Contact.

    b. If possession is unclear at the time of the tag, by default, with the action of the tag, the defensive player acknowledges a catch and possession by the offensive player.
    
       i. For example, if an offensive player makes a catch in the air, but has not, yet landed, thus verifying control and possession; but a defensive player tags them while still in the air, by default of the tag, the defensive player acknowledges the offensive player has caught the ball and the player will be ruled down at the spot of the tag.

       ii. This also means that if an offensive receiver gets tagged while attempting a catch in the air, but then drops the ball on the way down, he is still awarded a catch and the ball is spotted where the tag was made. This should minimize the unsafe, hard tags in mid-air or attempted push outs in mid-air.

       iii. As always, if a tag is made prematurely, (i.e. before the ball reaches the player), then a Pass Interference call should be made.

21. Blocking of any kind is not allowed. Running in front of a ball carrier (moving screen or moving pick) is considered blocking.

22. This is a non-contact league. Other than being tagged, there should be no other contact made.

23. If the offense fails to score by the end of their series, the ball is turned over on downs. The opposing team will begin their offensive series at the last spot of the ball.

24. The game will end with the expiration of the official game clock. If a play is in progress when the clock expires, the teams will be allowed to finish the play. The score at this time will decide the winner of the game. If the score is tied at this point, overtime rules will apply for post-season play only.

25. Any play that ends between the 5-yard line and the end zone toward which the player is advancing the ball (i.e., the defensive team's side of the field) will be spotted at the 5-yard line. There tends to be heightened levels of physicality and contact during goal line situations. This rule was enacted to minimize risk of injury by removing these situations from the game.

    a. If the referee deems that the defense is purposely taking penalties to keep the offense from scoring, given that the ball would not be advanced closer to the goalline, he/she has the authority to warn/eject any offending player and/or award a 6 or 8 point touchdown (depending on intended receiver) after multiple defensive fouls.

## Defense

1. This is a non-contact league. Hitting, blocking, bump-and-run, shoving and tackling are not allowed.

2. After a change of possession, or a time-out, the defense has 30 seconds to get set before the offense can snap the ball. This 30-seconds coincides with the 30-second play clock. The defense only gets this time consideration on the first play of an offensive series or after a time-out.

3. A defensive player must tag the ball carrier with two (2) hands and verbally acknowledge the tag.

   a. A defensive player MAY NOT hang onto a ball carrier's clothing with one hand while trying to tag them with their other hand.

4. If the defense stops the offense on downs, then the defense takes over at the last spot of the ball.

5. If a defense intercepts a pass or lateral, they may advance the ball until they are tagged down.

6. The defense may rush the quarterback after the referee (at the line of scrimmage) completes a 5-second count. The count must simulate 5-seconds.

7. The defensive player(s) who will rush the quarterback may line up anywhere on the defensive side of the ball. After the count any player or multiple players can rush the quarterback.

   a. The throwing arm (or the ball while it is in his or her hand) CANNOT be hit while in the process of throwing the ball by the pass rusher or rushers. This will result in an unsportsmanlike penalty being assessed to the defensive team. QB's that try to do something unnatural to draw this penalty will also draw an unsportsmanlike penalty.

8. Defenders may faceguard an offensive receiver, as long as no contact is made. Face guarding is the act of waving the hands or positioning the body in a manner to prevent the offensive player from seeing the ball.

## Penalties

### Offensive

1. **No female involvement:** If at the end of their 5th down, the offense has not had a play with female involvement.
   
   **Result:** Loss of down, resulting in a turnover on downs. When the opposing offense takes over, the ball will be spotted at the line of scrimmage for this past 5th down.

2. **Illegal formation/procedure:** An illegal formation occurs when all offensive players line up on one side of the ball or the team is not set prior to snapping the ball (i.e. multiple players in motion). An illegal procedure may be anything that goes against the rules of play.
   
   **Result:** 5 yard penalty & repeat down.

3. **Quarterback over the line of scrimmage:** When the quarterback crosses the line of scrimmage with the ball in his/her hand.
   
   **Result:** Play is blown dead, no penalty yardage assessed, down is over.

4. **Offsides/false start:** When a player crosses the line of scrimmage prior to the ball being snapped. The referee will drop a flag to identify the foul, but the play will continue to the end. At this time the referee will ask the defense if they would like to accept or decline the penalty.
   
   **Result:** 5 yard penalty & repeat down

5. **Offensive pick play:** When an offensive player makes a deliberate attempt (i.e. stopping their pass pattern and using their arms to block) to impede a defensive player's progress.
   
   **Result:** 5 yards & loss of down.

6. **Blocking:** When an offensive player physically blocks a defensive player or is running in front of the offensive ball carrier.
   
   **Result:** Play stops and the ball is spotted at point of infraction or where the ball carrier is located, whichever is farther from the end zone.

7. **Offensive pass interference/illegal contact:** When an offensive player makes illegal contact with a defensive player or pushes off of a defensive player to create separation between himself and the defensive player.
   
   **Result:** 5 yards & loss of down.

8. **Delay of game:** Occurs when after the referee spots the ball, the offense takes longer than 30-seconds to snap the ball for the next play.
   
   **Results:** 5 yards & repeat down.
   
   **Exception:** If there is less than 5 minutes remaining in the 2nd half, and the offense is leading in scoring, the game clock will stop until the ball is snapped. If the losing team makes any attempt to deliberately stop the game clock (throwing ball over fence) delay of game penalty will be enforced and the clock will continue to run.

9. **Grounding:** Occurs when the quarterback's attempted pass is thrown to the ground or thrown out of bounds without a receiver within 10 yards.
   
   **Result:** 10 yard penalty and loss of down.
   
   **Exception:** If there is less than 5 minutes remaining in the 2nd half, and the offense is leading in scoring, AND the ball is thrown out of bounds or over the fence and must be chased after, this should also be treated as Delay of Game, and the clock should be stopped.

10. **Unsportsmanlike Conduct:** The penalty may be assessed if a referee deems a player's conduct may be unsportsmanlike. This may include but is not limited to yelling at another player or official, offensive language and taunting.
    
    **Result:** 10 yards & repeat down. Referees have the ability to remove players and non-playing captains/coaches for a play, offensive series, remainder of the half or remainder of the game

### Defensive

1. **Defensive holding/Illegal Contact:** When a defensive player grabs the body or jersey, or makes any form of illegal contact with an offensive player that is not carrying the ball.
   
   **Result:** 10 yards & repeat down.

2. **Defensive pass interference:** Occurs when a defensive player makes contact that interferes with an offensive player's pass route or ability to catch the ball.
   
   **Result:** The ball is moved to the spot of foul & repeat down. If the intended receiver was a female player, the play will count as a female involvement play, even though the down will be repeated. If the infraction occurs in the end zone, the ball is spotted at the 5-yard line.

3. **Unsportsmanlike Conduct:** Occurs when a defensive player calls fake signals to draw an offensive player offsides. The penalty may also be assessed if a referee deems a player's conduct may be unsportsmanlike. This may include but is not limited to yelling at a player who is attempting to catch a pass, offensive language and taunting.
   
   **Result:** 10 yards & repeat down. Referees have the ability to remove players and non-playing captains/coaches for a play, offensive series, remainder of the half or remainder of the game.

4. **Offsides:** Occurs when a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage prior to completing a 5-second count or is not on their side of the ball at the snap. The referee will drop a flag to identify the foul, but the play will continue to the end. At this time the referee will ask the offense if they would like to accept or decline the penalty.
   
   **Result:** 5 yard penalty & repeat down

5. **NOTE:** A half cannot end on a defensive penalty. Even if time has expired, the offense will get to repeat their down.

## Divisions, Rankings & Playoffs

### Division Assignments

1. Divisions are created to allow teams of similar talent levels to play against each other and make the league more enjoyable for all teams.

   a. The number of divisions may fluctuate based on how many teams are in the league
   
   b. Teams are "graded on a curve" and placed within divisions accordingly

2. Veteran teams are known quantities and usually play in the same division as the previous season.

   a. If you win your division championship, you may be moved up one or more divisions

3. Game On! reserves the right to move or keep a team in any division to maintain balance within the league

### Team Rankings

1. Teams are ranked by a point system. A team will receive 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 points for a loss, and -1 point for a forfeit.

2. In the event 2 or more teams are tied in points, the following tie-breaking criteria will be used to separate teams. If more than 2 teams are tied, the tie-breakers are applied to find a single leader amongst the tied teams. Once that leader is determined, the remaining tied teams will begin at the top of the tie-breaking criteria. This process will continue until all ties have been resolved.

   a. Overall Greater # of Wins
   
   b. Head-to-Head Record
   
   c. Higher Points Scored Differential (shown as PSD in standings page)
   
   d. Coin Toss

### Playoffs

1. If a player's name is not on the official Game On! Roster at the time of the playoff game, they will not be allowed to participate in any playoff game.

2. This is a social league, therefore, everyone will make the playoffs in each division. We will determine, once the season ends, if 2 brackets need to be formed within a single division based on a clear separation in the standings.

   a. In some cases, larger divisions (12 teams or more) may be split at the start and each have their own playoff bracket where the winner of each bracket will play each other in the overall division championship.

3. Teams will NOT be re-seeded after each round of the playoffs. Teams will advance straight through the bracket, similar to NCAA basketball tourney. This eliminates teams waiting around all day to find out who won the other quarterfinal game and who plays who and at what time in the semifinals.

4. There is no "games played" requirement for participating in the playoffs.

5. Only players from your roster will be allowed to participate in the playoffs.

6. You may NOT borrow any players, or use Guest Passes for playoff games.

## Other

1. Please be sure to remove all items from the fields at the end of your game. This includes any trash (bottle, paper, wrappers, etc.). When the grounds crews have to clean up after us, it reduces the time they can be spending on upkeep of the playing surfaces.

2. The league has a zero tolerance policy regarding fighting. The player(s) fighting will be immediately and indefinitely expelled from the league and/or the team forfeits the game and/or season.

3. Player Ejection

   If an official ejects a player from a game, the player will not be eligible to play in the next scheduled game for which he/she is a team member.

   a. Example 1: A player is a member of multiple teams (i.e. different divisions) in the same league, Team A and Team B. Team B is playing at 10a, and the player gets ejected for swearing at the referee. Team B has no other games that day, but Team A has a game scheduled for 2p. The player will not be eligible to play in the 2p game.

   b. Example 2: A player is a member of multiple teams in the same league, Team C and Team D. Team D has a double header at 9a and 11a. Team C has a game at 10a. The player is ejected from the 9a game, for repeated and excessive illegal contact offenses. The player will not be able to play the 10a game with Team C. However, the player will be eligible for the 11a game with Team D.

   c. **NOTE:** This does not apply to a player who is asked to sit for a play or a series of plays. The player must be ejected for the remainder of the game for this to take effect.

4. Schedule Requests

   We will do our best to honor all schedule requests but sometimes it is not possible. Bye weeks will be given highest priority. Early Games (10 AM - 1 PM) and Late Games (1PM - 4PM) game requests will be given 2nd highest priority.

5. Rescheduling of Games

   If you elect to reschedule a game (with both parties in agreement and other logistics being covered), the new date and time must be known at the time of the reschedule. You may not have an if/then/maybe or otherwise open-ended game assignment.

6. The online copy of the rules is always the most current and accurate version.

7. Game On! Sports reserves the right to alter, modify, or change these rules at any time, for any reason, and without notice.
